# Homelab Operator
Homelab Operator displays your homelab infrastructure and provides actions such as wake-on-lan and ssh-shutdown. You can also create an overview of your services running on your machines. You can enable auto-wake where this tool wakes your servers based on usage heuristic (tbd) or create schedules to wake/shutdown your server (which are triggered by a cron job +/-5min).

It goes without saying: This tool is still in development while already being a helpful tool in my homelab.
